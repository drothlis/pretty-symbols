;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode for drawing multi-character tokens as Unicode glyphs
;; (lambda -> λ).
;;
;; Only works when `font-lock-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; This mode is heavily inspired by Trent Buck's pretty-symbols-mode[1]
;; and Arthur Danskin's pretty-mode[2]; but aims to replace those modes, and
;; the many others scattered on emacswiki.org, with:
;;
;; * A simple framework that others can use to define their own symbol
;;   replacements,
;; * that doesn't turn on all sorts of crazy mathematical symbols by default,
;; * is a self-contained project under source control, open to contributions,
;; * available from the MELPA package repository[4].
;;
;; You probably won't want to use this with haskell-mode which has its own much
;; fancier fontification[3]. Eventually it would be nice if this package grew
;; in power and became part of Emacs, so other packages could use it instead of
;; rolling their own.
;;
;; Add your own custom symbol replacements to the list
;; `pretty-symbol-patterns'.
;;
;; Only tested with GNU Emacs 24.

For example, in lisp modes draw λ instead of the characters
l a m b d a. The on-disk file keeps the original characters.

This may sound like a neat trick, but be extra careful: it
changes the line length and can thus lead to surprises with
respect to alignment and layout.

To enable, add to the hooks of the major modes you want pretty
symbols in: (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'pretty-symbols-mode)."
